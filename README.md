# Distance Matrix Calculator

Users enter points in the form x,y and output is a distance matrix which can be used to generate an MST.

This is a very simple program which helps to automate the creation of a distance matrix.  Once one has a distance matrix, it can be used to find 'short' routes using
- Nearest Neighbour
- Greedy
- Christofides (via an MST)

The intent is that this could be used to allow students exploring the TSP problem to generate tours for graphs with 20 points (or slightly more) so that the various 'shortest route' hueristics could be compared.
